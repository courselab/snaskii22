## This is a provision for build-time test.
##
## Briefly, the installed binary foo should read some installed data files.
## In order to be able to test the project without installing it, we want
## the non installed binary to read the non-installed data files, instead.
## To that end, use a wrapper script foo.sh that evokes the real binary
## foo.bin with appropriate command-line options to overwrite the data file
## path. The installation procedure, then,copies foo.bin into the binary
## installation path and renames it to foo.

# This will produce the script snaskii, which evokes snaskii.bin

snaskii : snaskii.sh
	cp $< $@
	chmod u+x $@

# This install snaskii.bin and rename it snaskii.

install-exec-hook:
	cd $(DESTDIR)/$(bindir) && mv $(bin_PROGRAMS) $(bin_SCRIPTS)

# This uninstall the binary

uninstall-hook:
	rm -f $(DESTDIR)/$(bindir)/$(bin_SCRIPTS)

# This removes the wrapper script.

clean-local:
	rm -f $(bin_SCRIPTS)
